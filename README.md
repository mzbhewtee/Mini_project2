## Resources Used for Assignment

This is a list of resources that I used to complete the assignment:

- [Flutter Official Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs) - Flutter is an open-source framework for developing high-performance, high-fidelity mobile apps for iOS, Android, and the web. I used the official documentation extensively to learn about Flutter widgets and how to implement various features such as animations, navigation, and Firebase authentication.

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) - YouTube is a great resource for Flutter tutorials and guides. I used it to supplement my learning from the official documentation, especially for more complex topics. The videos were helpful in giving me a better understanding of how to implement certain features and how to solve common issues.

- Practical Flutter Textbooks - I also referred to a few practical Flutter textbooks while working on the assignment. These books provided clear and concise explanations of how to perform certain widget functionality and best practices for Flutter development. They were helpful in allowing me to quickly find the answers to any questions that I had while coding.

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Finally, I used Figma for UI/UX design. The tool allowed me to create high-fidelity mockups of the app, which helped me get a better idea of how the final product would look and feel. I was also able to easily collaborate with my team members and make changes in real-time.

Overall, these resources were essential in completing the assignment. They provided me with the necessary knowledge and tools needed to create a functional and visually appealing app using Flutter.
